· Print car in the following format: "The car is: {brand} {model} – {horsePower} HP."

5. Company Roster
Define a class Employee that holds the following information: name, salary, position, department, email, and age. The name, salary, position, and department are mandatory, while the rest are optional.

Your task is to write a program that takes N lines of information about employees from the console and calculates the department with the highest average salary, and prints for each employee in that department his name, salary, email, and age - sorted by salary in descending order. If an employee doesn't have an email – in place of that field, you should print "n/a" instead, if he doesn't have an age – print "-1" instead. Print in the following format:

"Highest Average Salary: {department}

{name1} {salary1} {email1} {age1}

{name2} {salary2} {email2} {age2}

…

{namen} {salaryn} {emailn} {agen}"

The salary should be printed to two decimal places after the separator.

Hint: You can define a Department class that holds a list of employees.
